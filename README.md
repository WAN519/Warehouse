# Project Title: E-commerce warehouse database

## 📌 Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of an integrated warehouse
database system for an e-commerce platform, addressing the fundamental challenges
of inventory management, supply-chain monitoring, and sales analysis. Modern e-
commerce operations involve large-scale product catalogs, distributed warehouses,
multiple suppliers, and millions of user interactions. Without a unified and well-
structured data management system, issues such as overstocking, stockouts, inefficient
allocation, and fragmented logistics information can severely disrupt operational
efficiency.
